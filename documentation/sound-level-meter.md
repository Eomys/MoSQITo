## Sound level meter functions

### Introduction

There are operations that are important. We need to be able to perform them to have a better understanding of the data with which we work and to be able to use them to calculate data of interest. For this are the sonometer functions.

A step by step description of how to use MOSQITO to use the sonometer functions is given in [this tutorial](../tutorials/tuto_sound_level_meter.ipynb)

### Validation of the implementation
