    Parameters
    ----------
    fs: float

        Band number in which the filter is going to be applied over the signal.

    Returns
    -------
    centre_freq: float
        'Hz', central frequency of the filter.

    f_bandwidth: float
        Filter bandwidth.

    t_delay: float
        's'.

    d_coefficients: float
        "d coefficient", related with sampling rate and delay.

    sb: int
        Block size.
