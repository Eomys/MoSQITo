    ----------
    validation: boolean
        Default value is set to 'False'. It is used to mark whether complete validation is done or not.

    signal: numpy.array

    -------
    n_array: numpy.array
        'Sone per Bark'. It is a numpy array that is arranged as a matrix. Each matrix row represents a certain block of

    In the following section, the signal is filtered by a series of 53 asymmetric and overlapping filters. They are 
    supposed to replicate the activation process of the auditory hair cells, and their shape matches the one from the 
    gammatone filters. First, we have to calculate the parameters (central frequency, bandwidth, delay, and "d" 
    coefficient) that are going to define our filter and that are used in the recursive formula number 10. Second, 
    we have to link the critical band rate scale "z", with a certain hop size "sh_array" and its band dependent block 
    size "sb_array" (Table G.1). After that, it comes the coefficient calculation (Formula 11 and 12), in which we 
    compute the values for the filter coefficients (*), and we store them in a list. Finally, the end of this section 
    comes with the filtering of the signal.

    (*) An error in the standard has been found in expressions 13 and 14. The prior paragraph says that in order to 
    obtain the approximation of the band-pass filter, the low-pass filter coefficients shall be modified by adding a 
    negative exponential with the transformation parameters "complex_exponential". If we try to develop the filter with 
    these guidelines, we find that the resulting filter is a low-pass filter, not a band-pass. The actual way of 
    obtaining a band-pass filter by transforming a low-pass filter is to multiply the low pass filter coefficients in 
    time with a positive exponential. After the multiplication we will have complex filter coefficients, we have 2 
    options in order to fix this. Either we make 2 transformations, one to the right and another one to the left, and 
    we adapt the transformation parameter, or we take for granted the last transformation by discarding the complex part 
    of the filter and multiplying by "2" (two transformations) and by a cosine with the original transformation 
    parameter. We decided to implement the second option as they did on ECMA-418-2.
