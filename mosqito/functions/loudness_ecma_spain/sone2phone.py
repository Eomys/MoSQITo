    Parameters
    ----------
    sones: float
        One of the units in which loudness is measured. 1 sone equals to 40 phones. The conversion from sones to phones
        is not linear.

    -------
    phons: float
        Logarithmic unit of loudness (phon = Ln). The dB SPL values of the signal at 1 kHz have the same value in
        phons. For example, 50 db SPL @ 1 kHz corresponds to 50 phones. The rest of the frequencies does not have
        the same co-relation between each other.
