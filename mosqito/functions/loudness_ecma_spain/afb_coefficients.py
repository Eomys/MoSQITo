def afb_coefficients(fs, filter_order_k, centre_freq, d_coefficients):
    """Function for the calculation of the filter coefficients in the Auditory Filtering Bank section (5.1.3). Here, as
    it has been mentioned in the principal function for the specific loudness, it is calculated the band-pass equivalent
    of the low-pass filter. The typo/error found in the formulas (13 and 14) presented in the ECMA-418-2 has been
    already corrected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fs: float
        'Hz', sampling frequency.

    filter_order_k: int
        Order of the auditory filtering bank.

    centre_freq: float
        'Hz', central frequency of the filter.

    d_coefficients: float
        "d" coefficient, related with sampling rate and delay.

    Returns
    -------
    am_mod_coefficient_band_array: numpy.array
        "am" coefficient to filter a signal.

    bm_mod_coefficient_band_array: numpy.array
        "bm" coefficient to filter a signal.
