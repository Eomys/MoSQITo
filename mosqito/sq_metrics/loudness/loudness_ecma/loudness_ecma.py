    """Calculation of the specific and total loudness according to ECMA-418-2
    (2nd Ed, 2022), Section 5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal: numpy.array
        time signal values in 'Pa'. The sampling frequency of the signal must be 48000 Hz.
    sb: int or list of int
        block size.
    sh: int or list of int
        Hop size.

    Returns
    -------
    n_specific: list of numpy.array
        Specific Loudness [sone_HMS per Bark]. Each of the 53 element of the list corresponds to the time-dependant
        specific loudness for a given bark band. Can be a ragged array if a different sb/sh are used for each band.

    bark_axis: numpy.array
        Bark axis
