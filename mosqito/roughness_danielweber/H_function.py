    The code is based on the article "Psychoacoustical roughness:
    implementation of an optimized model" by Daniel and Weber in 1997.
    H2, H16 and H42 are given (figure 2), the others are derived from them
    in the following way:
        for i = 1,2, ... ,4 (Zi = 0.5,1, ... ,2 Bark)
            HI = H2 = H3 = H4
        for i = 6,8, ... , 16 (Zi = 3,4, ... ,8 Bark) :
            Hi-l = Hi and
            Hi is linearly interpolated between H4 and H16
        for i = 17,18,19,20 (Zi = 7.5,8, ... ,lOBark):
            Hi = H16
        for i = 22,24, ... ,42 (Zi = 11,12, ... ,21 Bark):
            Hi-l = Hi and
            Hi is linearly interpolated between H20 and H42
        for i = 43,44, ... ,47 (Zi = 21.5,22, ... ,23.5 Bark):
            Hi = H42.
