# MOSQITO Documentation

MOSQITO is a unified and modular development framework of sound quality tools (including key SQ metrics) favoring reproducible science and efficient shared scripting among engineers, teachers and researchers community.

In this folder, you will find the documentation and validation of the different functions implemented in MOSQITO.
