Architecture of the package
==============================


All the functions available in MOSQITO can be imported via the command:
    import mosqito


To import only a specific module like the sound quality metrics, the following command can be used:
    import mosqito.sq_metrics


The code of all the functions available in MOSQITO is accessible in the [mosqito](../mosqito) folder, sorted by module. Each subfolder contains one main function that is intended to be called by the user. The subfunctions are identified by a trailing underscore. Each main function is accompanied by a documentation (in the [docs](.) folder), a tutorial (in the [tutorials](../tutorials) folder) and a detailed validation of the implementation in the [validations](../validations) folder. 

For example, considering the function to compute the acoustic loudness according to the Zwicker method for stationary signals, the folowing elements can be found in MOSQITO:
- source code of the function and subfunctions in the [mosqito/sq_metrics/loudness/loudness_zwst](../mosqito/sq_metrics/loudness/loudness_zwst/) folder,
- source code of the main function in the [loudness_zwst.py](../mosqito/sq_metrics/loudness/loudness_zwst/loudness_zwst.py) file,
- documentation in the [docs/loudness_zwst.md](../docs/loudness_zwst.md) file,  
- tutorial explaining how to use the function in the [tutorials/tuto_loudness_zwst.ipynb](../tutorials/tuto_loudness_zwst.ipynb) file,
- script used to validate the implementation by using the tests signals from the IS0 532-1 standard is available, together with the output of the validation process, in the [validations/sq_metrics/loudness_zwst](../validations/sq_metrics/loudness_zwst) folder.
