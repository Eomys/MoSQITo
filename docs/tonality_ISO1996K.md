## Tone detection according to ISO 1996-2 Annex K

### Introduction
ISO 1996-2 introduces different methods for determining the presence of a prominent discrete frequency spectral component (tone).  

In particular, Annex K describes the calculations for applying the "Objective method for the assessment of the audibility of tones in noise", also known as the "Inspection method".  

These calculations are based on the comparison of time-averaged sound pressure levels in one-third octave bands taking into account the frequency range in which these levels are found.

### Validation
The validation of the function has been performed by testing the function to perform tone detection using different signals: pure tones at low, medium and high frequencies, multi-tone signals and atonal signals.
By means of manual calculations, it is verified that the calculations obtained with the function are correct.
