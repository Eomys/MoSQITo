# MOSQITO Tutorials

MOSQITO is a unified and modular development framework of sound quality tools (including key SQ metrics) favoring reproducible science and efficient shared scripting among engineers, teachers and researchers community.

In this folder, you will find the tutorials explaining how to use the different functions of MOSQITO.

## Generalities

- [Tutorial](./tuto_signal_basic_operations.ipynb): **Basic operation** on audio signal (import and plot time history)

## Sound quality metrics

- [Tutorial](./tuto_loudness_zwst.ipynb): How to compute **loudness (Zwicker method for stationary signals)**
- [Tutorial](./tuto_loudness_zwtv.ipynb): How to compute **loudness (Zwicker method for time_varying signals)**
- [Tutorial](./tuto_sharpness_din.ipynb): How to compute **sharpness**
- [Tutorial](./tuto_roughness_dw.ipynb): How to compute **roughness**
- [Tutorial](./tuto_TNR_PR.ipynb): How to compute **tonality** (work in progress)
